# Database Schema Enhancement Project

## Project Overview

## SQL Reserved Words Handling

To ensure compatibility with ERwin and various SQL database systems, we've taken the following approach to handle SQL reserved words in our schema:

### Reserved Words Modified

We've identified and renamed the following SQL reserved words to avoid potential conflicts:

| Original Name | New Name      | Reason for Change |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| `Definition`  | `DefinitionText` | Avoids conflict with SQL reserved word |
| `Role`        | `RoleType`    | Avoids conflict with SQL reserved word |
| `Description` | `DescriptionText` | Avoids conflict with SQL reserved word |
| `Criteria`    | `CriteriaText` | Avoids conflict with SQL reserved word |
| `Threshold`   | `ThresholdValue` | Avoids conflict with SQL reserved word |
| `Level`       | `LevelNum`    | Avoids conflict with SQL reserved word |
| `ASC`         | `ASC_Table`   | Avoids conflict with SQL ORDER BY clause |

### Implementation Approach

1. **Consistent Naming**: All renamed columns follow a consistent naming pattern (appending 'Text' or 'Type' as appropriate)
2. **Foreign Key Updates**: All related foreign key constraints have been updated to reference the new column names
3. **Documentation**: This documentation serves as a reference for developers to understand the naming conventions used
4. **ERwin Compatibility**: These changes ensure better compatibility with ERwin data modeling tools

### Example Changes

```sql
-- Before
CREATE TABLE SomeTable (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    [Description] TEXT,
    [Level] INT
);

-- After
CREATE TABLE SomeTable (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DescriptionText TEXT,
    LevelNum INT
);
```

## Project Overview

This project enhances the database schema based on business cases from the EDA Project Support Material to support complex business scenarios. The project addresses multiple key many-to-many relationships and business rules in the insurance industry.

## Case Study Solutions

### Case 1: Account to BillingAccount Many-to-Many Relationship

#### Business Scenario
**WalMart Columbus Multiple Billing Address Scenario**

WalMart Columbus uses 3 different PO boxes to receive different types of invoices:
- FSA (Flexible Spending Account) invoices
- Life insurance invoices
- A&H (Accident & Health) insurance invoices

Additionally, these invoices need to distinguish between employee types:
- **Salaried employees**
- **Hourly employees**

#### Data Model Problem
The original `Account_BillingAccount` junction table cannot distinguish employee type differences when the same account uses different billing addresses.

#### Solution
Add an `EmployeeType` field to the `Account_BillingAccount` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Account_BillingAccount
ADD COLUMN EmployeeType VARCHAR(8) CHECK (EmployeeType IN ('salaried', 'hourly'));
```

#### Implementation Details
- **Field Name**: `EmployeeType`
- **Data Type**: `VARCHAR(8)`
- **Constraint**: `CHECK` constraint, only allows `'salaried'` or `'hourly'` values
- **Business Purpose**: Allows the same Account to establish multiple relationships with the same BillingAccount, each corresponding to a different employee type

#### Usage Example
```sql
-- WalMart Columbus FSA invoice configuration
INSERT INTO Account_BillingAccount (
    AccountName, LocationAddress1, LocationCity, LocationState, LocationZip, CompanyCode,
    BAccName, BillingAddress1, BillingCity, BillingState, BillingZip,
    RelationshipType, StartDate, EmployeeType
) VALUES 
    ('WalMart', '123 Main St', 'Columbus', 'OH', '43215', 'WM',
     'WalMart FSA Billing', 'PO Box 1001', 'Columbus', 'OH', '43216',
     'FSA_Billing', '2024-01-01', 'salaried'),
    ('WalMart', '123 Main St', 'Columbus', 'OH', '43215', 'WM',
     'WalMart FSA Billing', 'PO Box 1002', 'Columbus', 'OH', '43216',
     'FSA_Billing', '2024-01-01', 'hourly');
```

### Case 2: Associate to ManagerContract One-to-Many Relationship

#### Business Scenario
**Associate's Multiple Writing Numbers and SitCode Management**

A company Associate (agent) can have multiple Writing Numbers, each authorized by a specific state's Department of Insurance (State DOI). Each Writing Number can have multiple SitCodes (i.e., ManagerContracts) for conducting new business.

**SitCode Types**:
- **SitCode0** (Primary SitCode): Represents the Associate's formal reporting chain within the company
  - Defines the Associate's official upline: DSC (District Sales Coordinator), RSC (Regional Sales Coordinator), SSC (State Sales Coordinator), TD (Territory Director)
  
- **Other SitCodes** (Secondary SitCodes): Represent "side deals" where the Associate conducts business outside their SitCode0's jurisdiction

#### Real-World Example
**Keith's Cross-State Business Scenario**:

1. **Keith's Primary Business** (SitCode0):
   - Upline chain: Cliff (DSC) → Rob (RSC) → David (SSC) → Gerald (TD)
   - David's state operation area: Georgia (GA)

2. **Keith's Side Business** (SitCodeA):
   - Keith obtained a sales license in Alabama (AL)
   - Keith made a side deal with Jim in AL
   - New upline chain: Jim (DSC) → Ken (RSC) → Pat (SSC) → Gerald (TD)

#### Data Model Problem
The original `ManagerContract` table cannot distinguish between primary SitCode and side business SitCode.

#### Solution
Add a `SitCodeType` field to the `ManagerContract` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE ManagerContract
ADD COLUMN SitCodeType TINYINT(1) CHECK (SitCodeType IN (0, 1));
```

#### Implementation Details
- **Field Name**: `SitCodeType`
- **Data Type**: `TINYINT(1)`
- **Constraint**: `CHECK` constraint, only allows `0` or `1` values
  - `0` = Primary SitCode (SitCode0), represents formal reporting chain
  - `1` = Side business SitCode, represents cross-regional business agreement
- **Business Purpose**: Identifies the Associate's business relationship type, supporting cross-state sales and multiple management structures

#### Usage Example
```sql
-- Keith's primary SitCode (in Georgia)
INSERT INTO ManagerContract (
    SitCode, SitCodeType, CompanyCode, WritingNumber, Level, IssueDate,
    ContractType, TerritoryName, StateOperationName, StateCode,
    AssocLastName, AssocFirstName, AssocMiddleInitial, AssocSuffix, AssocDOB
) VALUES (
    'KEITH-GA-001', 0, 'ABC', 'WN12345', 3, '2023-01-01',
    'Standard', 'Southeast', 'Georgia Operations', 'GA',
    'Smith', 'Keith', 'J', 'Jr', '1980-05-15'
);

-- Keith's side business SitCode (in Alabama)
INSERT INTO ManagerContract (
    SitCode, SitCodeType, CompanyCode, WritingNumber, Level, IssueDate,
    ContractType, TerritoryName, StateOperationName, StateCode,
    AssocLastName, AssocFirstName, AssocMiddleInitial, AssocSuffix, AssocDOB
) VALUES (
    'KEITH-AL-001', 1, 'ABC', 'WN12346', 3, '2023-06-01',
    'Side_Deal', 'Southeast', 'Alabama Operations', 'AL',
    'Smith', 'Keith', 'J', 'Jr', '1980-05-15'
);
```

### Case 3: Customer Many-to-Many Relationship Complex Scenarios

This section addresses multiple many-to-many relationships between the Customer entity and other entities, which are very common in the insurance business.

#### Case 3: Customer (n..n) Customer - Family Relationships

**Business Scenario: Daddy Warbucks' Family Policy**

Daddy Warbucks purchases health insurance for his son and family. He establishes a trust fund to pay for the policy and purchases a dread disease rider specifically for his son.

**Data Model Problem**:
- Need to record relationships between customers (parent-child, spouse, etc.)
- The existing `CustomerRelation` table can handle this situation

**Solution**:
Use the existing `CustomerRelation` table, which already supports many-to-many relationships between customers.

```sql
-- Example: Record the relationship between Daddy Warbucks and his son
INSERT INTO CustomerRelation (
    CustLastName, CustFirstName, CustMiddleInitial, CustSuffix, CustDOB,
    RelationLastName, RelationFirstName, RelationMiddleInitial, RelationSuffix, RelationDOB,
    RelationToCustomer, StartDate
) VALUES (
    'Warbucks', 'Daddy', 'D', '', '1960-01-01',
    'Warbucks', 'Junior', 'J', '', '1990-05-15',
    'Father-Son', '1990-05-15'
);
```

---

### Case 4: Customer (n..n) Contract - Multiple Roles in Contracts

**Business Scenario: Complex Policy Relationships**

In Daddy Warbucks' case:
- **Policy Owner**: Daddy Warbucks
- **Policy Payer**: Warbucks Family Trust Fund
- **Insured**: Son and his family
- Daddy also has his own life insurance policy

**Data Model Problem**:
A simple Customer-Contract junction table cannot distinguish the different roles customers play in a contract.

**Solution**:
Create a `ContractingParty` table to explicitly define each customer's role in a contract.

First, ensure the role definition table exists:
```sql
CREATE TABLE ContractingPartyRole (
  Role VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  Description TEXT,
  CONSTRAINT PK_ContractingPartyRole PRIMARY KEY (Role)
);

-- Insert common roles
INSERT INTO ContractingPartyRole (Role, Description) VALUES
  ('Owner', 'Policy Owner'),
  ('Payer', 'Policy Payer'),
  ('Insured', 'Insured Party'),
  ('Beneficiary', 'Beneficiary');
```

Then create the junction table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE ContractingParty (
  ContractNumber VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  LineOfBusiness VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  SeriesName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  PlanName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  CustLastName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  CustFirstName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  CustMiddleInitial CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
  CustSuffix VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  CustDOB DATE NOT NULL,
  Role VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT PK_ContractingParty PRIMARY KEY (
    ContractNumber, LineOfBusiness, SeriesName, PlanName, 
    CustLastName, CustFirstName, CustDOB, Role
  ),
  CONSTRAINT FK_ContractingParty_Contract FOREIGN KEY (
    ContractNumber, LineOfBusiness, SeriesName, PlanName
  ) REFERENCES Contract(ContractNumber, LineOfBusiness, SeriesName, PlanName),
  CONSTRAINT FK_ContractingParty_Customer FOREIGN KEY (
    CustLastName, CustFirstName, CustMiddleInitial, CustSuffix, CustDOB
  ) REFERENCES Customer(CustLastName, CustFirstName, CustMiddleInitial, CustSuffix, CustDOB),
  CONSTRAINT FK_ContractingParty_Role FOREIGN KEY (Role)
    REFERENCES ContractingPartyRole(Role)
);
```

**Usage Example**:
```sql
-- Daddy Warbucks' health insurance contract
INSERT INTO ContractingParty VALUES
  ('HC001', 'Health', 'Family', 'Premium', 'Warbucks', 'Daddy', 'D', '', '1960-01-01', 'Owner'),
  ('HC001', 'Health', 'Family', 'Premium', 'Warbucks Trust', '', '', '', '1950-01-01', 'Payer'),
  ('HC001', 'Health', 'Family', 'Premium', 'Warbucks', 'Junior', 'J', '', '1990-05-15', 'Insured');

-- Daddy's life insurance
INSERT INTO ContractingParty VALUES
  ('LC001', 'Life', 'Standard', 'Term', 'Warbucks', 'Daddy', 'D', '', '1960-01-01', 'Owner'),
  ('LC001', 'Life', 'Standard', 'Term', 'Warbucks', 'Daddy', 'D', '', '1960-01-01', 'Insured');
```

---

### Case 5: Customer (n..n) ContractBenefit - Specific Benefit Recipients

**Business Scenario: Granular Beneficiary Designation**

- Daddy Warbucks' health insurance covers his son and family (they are policy beneficiaries)
- The Dread Disease Rider is purchased only for the son
- The son also purchases the company's accident insurance for himself and his family

**Data Model Problem**:
Need to designate specific customers as beneficiaries of specific benefits (Riders), not just the entire contract.

**Solution**:
Create a `BenefitRecipient` table to link customers directly to specific contract benefits.

```sql
CREATE TABLE BenefitRecipient (
  ContractNumber VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  LineOfBusiness VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  SeriesName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  PlanName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  RiderName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  CustLastName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  CustFirstName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  CustMiddleInitial CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
  CustSuffix VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  CustDOB DATE NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT PK_BenefitRecipient PRIMARY KEY (
    ContractNumber, LineOfBusiness, SeriesName, PlanName, RiderName, 
    CustLastName, CustFirstName, CustDOB
  ),
  CONSTRAINT FK_BenefitRecipient_ContractBenefit FOREIGN KEY (
    ContractNumber, LineOfBusiness, SeriesName, PlanName, RiderName
  ) REFERENCES ContractBenefit(ContractNumber, LineOfBusiness, SeriesName, PlanName, RiderName),
  CONSTRAINT FK_BenefitRecipient_Customer FOREIGN KEY (
    CustLastName, CustFirstName, CustMiddleInitial, CustSuffix, CustDOB
  ) REFERENCES Customer(CustLastName, CustFirstName, CustMiddleInitial, CustSuffix, CustDOB)
);
```

**Usage Example**:
```sql
-- Dread disease rider purchased only for Junior
INSERT INTO BenefitRecipient VALUES (
  'HC001', 'Health', 'Family', 'Premium', 'Dread Disease',
  'Warbucks', 'Junior', 'J', '', '1990-05-15'
);

-- Junior's accident insurance covers him and his family
INSERT INTO BenefitRecipient VALUES
  ('AC001', 'Accident', 'Standard', 'Basic', 'Accident Coverage',
   'Warbucks', 'Junior', 'J', '', '1990-05-15'),
  ('AC001', 'Accident', 'Standard', 'Basic', 'Accident Coverage',
   'Warbucks', 'Jane', 'M', '', '1992-03-20');
```

### Case 6: Customer (n..n) Account - Multiple Employment Relationships

**Business Scenario: Keith's Multiple Jobs**

Dana's Dry Cleaning has many employees, including Keith. Keith can work at Dana's Dry Cleaning and moonlight at Scott's Garage simultaneously.

**Data Model Problem**:
A customer can be an employee at multiple accounts (employers) at the same time.

**Solution**:
No changes needed. The existing `Account_Member` table already perfectly supports this scenario.

```sql
-- Keith works at Dana's Dry Cleaning
INSERT INTO Account_Member (
    AccountName, LocationAddress1, LocationCity, LocationState, LocationZip,
    CustLastName, CustFirstName, CustMiddleInitial, CustDOB, StartDate,
    CustSuffix, CompanyCode
) VALUES (
    'Dana Dry Cleaning', '100 Main St', 'Springfield', 'IL', '62701',
    'Smith', 'Keith', 'J', '1985-07-20', '2020-01-15',
    'Jr', 'DDC'
);

-- Keith moonlights at Scott's Garage
INSERT INTO Account_Member (
    AccountName, LocationAddress1, LocationCity, LocationState, LocationZip,
    CustLastName, CustFirstName, CustMiddleInitial, CustDOB, StartDate,
    CustSuffix, CompanyCode
) VALUES (
    'Scott Garage', '200 Oak Ave', 'Springfield', 'IL', '62702',
    'Smith', 'Keith', 'J', '1985-07-20', '2021-06-01',
    'Jr', 'SG'
);
```

### Case 7: Customer (n..n) Associate - Commission Bequests

**Business Scenario: Walt and Dave's Bequests**

- Walt is a long-standing sales associate of the company who passes away and bequeaths his commissions to his wife and son
- Dave, another long-standing company sales associate and friend of Walt's family, also passes away and bequeaths his commissions to Walt's son

**Data Model Problem**:
Need to record relationships where non-associates (Customers) receive commissions from associates (Associates), such as through bequests.

**Solution**:
Create an `AssociateBeneficiary` table to manage these beneficiary designations.

```sql
CREATE TABLE AssociateBeneficiary (
  -- Associate who is bequeathing
  AssocLastName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  AssocFirstName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  AssocMiddleInitial CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
  AssocSuffix VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  AssocDOB DATE NOT NULL,
  -- Customer who is the beneficiary
  CustLastName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  CustFirstName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  CustMiddleInitial CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
  CustSuffix VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  CustDOB DATE NOT NULL,
  -- Additional Details
  DesignationType VARCHAR(50), -- e.g., 'Bequest', 'Commission Split'
  Percentage DECIMAL(5, 2),    -- Benefit percentage
  EffectiveDate DATE,           -- Effective date
  CONSTRAINT PK_AssociateBeneficiary PRIMARY KEY (
    AssocLastName, AssocFirstName, AssocDOB, 
    CustLastName, CustFirstName, CustDOB
  ),
  CONSTRAINT FK_AssociateBeneficiary_Associate FOREIGN KEY (
    AssocLastName, AssocFirstName, AssocMiddleInitial, AssocSuffix, AssocDOB
  ) REFERENCES Associate(AssocLastName, AssocFirstName, AssocMiddleInitial, AssocSuffix, AssocDOB),
  CONSTRAINT FK_AssociateBeneficiary_Customer FOREIGN KEY (
    CustLastName, CustFirstName, CustMiddleInitial, CustSuffix, CustDOB
  ) REFERENCES Customer(CustLastName, CustFirstName, CustMiddleInitial, CustSuffix, CustDOB)
);
```

**Usage Example**:
```sql
-- Walt bequeaths commissions to his wife (50%) and son (50%)
INSERT INTO AssociateBeneficiary VALUES
  ('Johnson', 'Walt', 'W', '', '1950-03-10',
   'Johnson', 'Mary', 'M', '', '1952-06-15',
   'Bequest', 50.00, '2024-01-15'),
  ('Johnson', 'Walt', 'W', '', '1950-03-10',
   'Johnson', 'Tom', 'T', 'Jr', '1980-09-20',
   'Bequest', 50.00, '2024-01-15');

-- Dave bequeaths commissions to Walt's son (100%)
INSERT INTO AssociateBeneficiary VALUES
  ('Smith', 'Dave', 'D', '', '1948-11-05',
   'Johnson', 'Tom', 'T', 'Jr', '1980-09-20',
   'Bequest', 100.00, '2024-02-20');
```
